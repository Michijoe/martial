# XLS TO JSON FORMAT
There are several ways to convert an Excel (XLS) file to a JSON format file. Here are a few approaches:

## Using a Programming Language
Many programming languages have libraries that can read Excel files and convert them to JSON. For example, in Python, you can use pandas and openpyxl to read the Excel file and json to write the JSON file.

### Install Python and dependencies
```brew install python3```
```pip3 install pandas```
```pip3 install openpyxl```

### Run program
```python3 xlsTojson.py```

## Using Online Tools
There are many online tools that can convert Excel files to JSON. You just need to upload your Excel file, and the tool will generate a JSON file that you can download. Examples of such tools include beautifytools.com and convertcsv.com.

## Using Excel Add-ins
Some Excel add-ins can convert Excel data to JSON. For example, the Excel to JSON Converter add-in can convert Excel data to JSON directly within Excel.

## Using Command Line Tools
Command line tools like in2csv (part of csvkit) can convert Excel files to CSV, and then jq or csvjson (part of csvkit) can convert CSV to JSON.

```
# Convert Excel to CSV
in2csv file.xls > file.csv

# Convert CSV to JSON
csvjson file.csv > file.json
```

# MARTIALS ARTS ALGORITHM
Creating an algorithm to determine a recommended martial sport based on user preferences can be approached in various ways. Here’s a breakdown of the approach you’re suggesting and some possible improvements.

## Incremental Scoring
Incrementing a score based on the user's answers and then selecting a martial art depending on the score range allows for flexibility in weighting different answers. Here's how it might work:

Assign Points: Each answer option can be assigned a specific point value associated with a particular martial art. For example:

Light Contact -> Aikido: +2 points
Full Contact -> Muay Thai: +5 points
Accumulate Score: As the user answers each question, you accumulate the score in variables associated with each martial art.

Score Ranges: At the end of the quiz, you can compare the total scores across the different martial arts and recommend the one with the highest score, or check if the score falls within a certain range.

## Weighted Scores Based on Importance:
Use a Weighting Factor: Some questions might be more important than others. For example, if a question about the user's experience level is critical, you could multiply the score from that answer by a weighting factor.
Dynamic Weighting: You could dynamically adjust weighting based on earlier answers (e.g., if a user indicates a strong preference for contact sports early on).

## Hierarchical Decision-Making: 
Instead of a simple point system, you can design a decision tree where each answer leads the user down a path that narrows down the choices. This method is more deterministic and works well if your questions have clear-cut categories.

## Score Matrix: 
Create a matrix where rows represent questions and columns represent possible answers. Each cell contains a score that contributes to the overall score of each martial art. This method provides fine-grained control over how different answers impact the final recommendation.

## Machine Learning (Advanced):
Pattern Recognition: If you have a large dataset of previous user responses, you could use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and predict the most suitable martial art based on new responses. This would be more complex and require training data, but it could yield more personalized results.
